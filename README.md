It explains how to log Humidity & Temperature data on the cloud. We can use Thingspeak as a cloud service provider and DHT11 to measure temperature and humidity

# About DHT11

The DHT11 is a basic, ultra low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed).

Itâ€™s fairly simple to use but requires careful timing to grab data. The only real downside of this sensor is you can only get new data from it once every 2 seconds, so when using the library, sensor readings can be up to 2 seconds old.
